## Full Stack Scope

These projects demonstrate **_end-to-end system ownership_**, covering all layers of the network infrastructure, game mechanics, and operations:

- **Game Layer / Frontend (Minecraft In-Game):**  
  - Developed custom **Bukkit/Paper/Spigot plugins** for FFA (SG & UHC), Survival Games, UHC Games, UHC, UHC MeetUp, ELO, Core, Lobby.  
  - Designed **_player-facing UI_** including scoreboards, inventories, menus, and command flows.  
  - **_Reverse-engineered legacy plugins_** (Survival Games, UHC Games, UHC Meetup) for maintainability and feature expansion.  

- **Application Layer / Backend:**  
  - Managed **_game state, matchmaking, and multi-node orchestration_** across BungeeCord networks.  
  - Implemented **_database systems_** using MySQL and Redis, including cache pipelines and replication.  
  - Developed **_custom APIs_** to integrate game logic with external services and cross-server features.  

- **Infrastructure / DevOps / Security:**  
  - Maintained production **_Linux servers_**, including **iptables firewalling** and uptime / DDoS monitoring.  
  - Automated builds, deployments, and **custom CI/DI scripts** to manage live plugin/map updates and rollbacks.  
  - Configured and maintained **_web services, Teamspeak 3, Xenforo, Apache, and custom web panels_** for live network management.  

- **Operations / Network Management:**  
  - Oversaw **_live production_** of multi-server network, revamps / rebrands / updates.  
  - Managed **_network-wide configs_** for plugins, forums, and backend services.  
  - Coordinated with staff, reviewed candidates, and ensured operational stability for concurrent players (~*100 avg*, ~*300 peak*).  

This **Full Stack Scope** demonstrates the ability to own a project from conception through live deployment, including **_engineering, operations, security, and leadership responsibilities_**, highlighting a trajectory from **_plugin developer_** to **_Owner Developer (CTO)_**.
